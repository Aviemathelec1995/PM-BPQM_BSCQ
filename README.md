# PM-BPQM_BSCQ

The repository contains code to find the threshold for regular LDPC or LDGM code in the delta, gamma (or theta, p) parameter domain
for Binary Symmetric Classical Quantum channels.

For More Details follow- 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04984'

Run theshold_main.py to determine the threshold in theta,p domain

One set of sample parameters has been shown theshold_main.py.
